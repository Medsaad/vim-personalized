## Vim Personalization

After running:

```bash
chmod +x ./init.sh && ./init.sh
```

The following will be applied to your vim:

- NERDTree gets installed (a tool to navigate between files and directories inside vim)
- `.vimrc` will be created in your file with some basic settings like showing line numbers, indentation, etc.
- The gruvbox theme will be installed and ready in your machine.
